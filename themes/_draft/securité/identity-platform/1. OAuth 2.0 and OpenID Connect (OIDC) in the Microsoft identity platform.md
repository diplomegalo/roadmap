# Authentication vs. authorization

## Authentication

_Authentication_ is the process of proving that you are who you say you are. The Microsoft identity platform uses the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) protocol for handling authentication.

## Authorization

_Authorization_ is the act of granting an authenticated party permission to do something. The Microsoft identity platform uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol for handling authorization.

# Actors

- **Authorization server** (IDP) : The Microsoft Identity platform. It handles
	- the end-user's information,
	- their access,
	- the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow.
- **Client**: The application requesting access to a protected resource. It could be
	- web app running on a server,
	- a single-page web app running in a user's web browser,
	- or a web API that calls another web API.
- **Resource owner**: The application user or _end-user_ in OAuth terminology.
- **Resource server**: The web API fronting a data store.

# Tokens

The **bearer tokens** (JWT) is used to:
- assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service),
- grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization).

Three types of _security tokens_ are issued by the authorization server:
- **Access tokens**: contains the permissions the client has been granted by the authorization server,
- **ID tokens**: contains basic information about user (use when signing in),
- **Refresh tokens**: has no content, used to request new access and ID tokens from the authorization server.

# App registration

[Register your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app) with the identity platform in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

- **Application (client) ID**: identifies your app in the identity platform and is included in the security tokens the platform issues.
- **Redirect URI**: redirects owner's _user-agent_ (web browser, mobile app) after completing interactions. Not all client types use redirect URIs.

# Endpoints

The Microsoft identity platform offers authentication and authorization services using standards-compliant implementations of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 1.0.
