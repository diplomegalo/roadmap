# Application categories

Tokens can be acquired from several types of applications, including:

- Web apps
- Mobile apps
- Desktop apps
- Web APIs

## Protected resources vs. client applications

- **Acquiring security tokens for a protected web API**
- **Protecting a web API or a web app**

## With users or without users

Most authentication scenarios acquire tokens on behalf of signed-in users.  
However, there are also daemon (service) apps. In these scenarios, applications acquire tokens on behalf of themselves with no user.

- **Single-page applications**: tokens are acquired by a JavaScript or TypeScript app running in the browser. Use MSAL.js
- **Public client applications**: call web APIs on behalf of signed-in users
	- Desktop apps
	- Mobile apps
	- Apps running on devices that don't have a browser, like those running on IoT
- **Confidential client applications**:
	- Web apps that call a web API
	- Web APIs that call a web API
	- Daemon apps
